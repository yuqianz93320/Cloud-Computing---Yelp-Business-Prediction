In our project, we aim to predict wether a user will like certain business appeared on yelp’s website based on his or her previous behavior related to their review information, demographical information and information on businesses’ side. We perform our predictive classification on Apache Hadoop based on Cloud Computing platform. Not only the prediction models are analyzed in our project, we also performed comparison between different system and platform across our prediction process.
